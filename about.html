                <p>     Connor Solawetz was born and raised in Evergreen, Colorado.
                    Growing up in the mountains, he cultivated a love of adventure
                    and the outdoors.  Many days were spent roaming around the mountains 
                    near his home as well as playing sports such as football, lacrosse, rugby,
                    and hockey throughout high school.  After graduating from Evergreen High
                    School in 2015, Connor spent a brief semester at Montana State University in 
                    Bozeman before moving back home.  The next several years were spent working in 
                    a restaurant while attaining an Associate's of Science Degree from Red Rocks 
                    Community College in Denver.  Connor currently is based out of Lakewood, Colorado.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>     Currently working in an Alaskan-themed restaurant and bar, Connor has cultivated excellent
                    interpersonal skills over 10 years in the customer service industry.  Always ready for
                    a new challenge, he is currently working through a Coding Bootcamp.  Some of Connor's 
                    interests include music, reading, writing, and adventuring outdoors.
